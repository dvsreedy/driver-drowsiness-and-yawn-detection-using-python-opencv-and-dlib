# driver-drowsiness-and-yawn-detection-using-python-opencv-and-dlib
this code works with OpenCV and dlib, it is difficult to install dlib on your system sometimes. you can use OpenCV and make some changes in the code and use it.
it is recommended to use dlib because it gives more accuracy.
python modules are required.
1)numpy
2)playsound
3)argparse
4)imutils
5)time
6)dlib
7)cv2
8)Gtts
If you want to run this file u should have dlib facial landmark detector and harcascade files in the folder of the code.
if Gtts module is used the data connectivity is a must because the text is converted into sound using google api.
and alarms can be customizable.
